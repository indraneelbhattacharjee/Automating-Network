# Automating-Network

the code defines the parameters for two Cisco IOS routers and establishes an SSH connection to each device using the Netmiko library.
It then sends a set of configuration commands to each router to configure the IP address of a GigabitEthernet interface. 
Finally, the code prints the output of the configuration commands and disconnects from each router.
Note that this is just a basic example and that automating a network can involve more complex tasks, such as configuring routing protocols, setting up VLANs, or deploying network security policies.
The specific tasks involved in automating a network will depend on the goals of the automation project and the specific network infrastructure being used.
